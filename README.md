# Week 2 Lab

## Purpose
This program simulates rolling a dice to select a weapon and calculates the hero's combat strength based on the dice roll.

## Tasks Completed
1. Defined an array of weapons: `["Fist", "Knife", "Club", "Gun", "Bomb", "Nuclear bomb"]`.
2. Simulated a dice roll to select a weapon.
3. Used conditional statements to evaluate the weapon's strength:
   - Weak weapons (roll ≤ 2)
   - Medium-strength weapons (roll ≤ 4)
   - Strong weapons (roll > 4)
4. Added logic to print additional messages based on the selected weapon.
5. Tested the program with different dice rolls.

## How to Run
1. Open the `week2lab.py` file in PyCharm.
2. Click the green play button or use **Shift + F10** to run the program.
3. Observe the output in the terminal.
